# ZTools

ZTools is a collection of PowerShell scripts and utilities I use for day-to-day tasks at work. The repository is currently a skeleton that will be populated with organized tools over time.

## Project Goals

- Provide a central location for PowerShell scripts used in administrative and automation tasks.
- Organize scripts in a clear directory structure for easier maintenance.
- Document usage so that anyone on the team can leverage these tools.

## Repository Structure

```
ZTools/
├── scripts/       # Standalone PowerShell scripts
├── modules/       # Reusable PowerShell modules
├── LICENSE        # MIT License
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

*This layout may evolve as more tools are added.*
These directories will be added as tools are introduced.
